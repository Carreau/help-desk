# Escherpad Help Desk

This is a github repo used for all of the discussion on Escherpad. 

You can:

- ask for new features, 
- file bug reports on existing features, 
- talk to each other
- hit us with a stick if we break things.

We also have a gitter channel here! [link to our channel](https://gitter.im/escherpad/help-desk)
